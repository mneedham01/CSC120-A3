Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which classmates did you consult with while working on this assignment?
I consulted Logan Hankla and Hannah Sun.
- Which session(s) of TA / office hours did you attend?
I attended the Tuesday night session of TA hours.
- What are your initial impressions of Java? 
I thought it was mostly fine, though definitely required a lot more specification and plannign ahead.. 
- Can you draw any conclusion about programming in general from the similarities or the differences between the two languages? 
I think that in programming, like writing and creating in general, the language in which you are writing is 
incredibly important in shaping your thinking, process, and final product. 
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
Coming up with the big-picture scheming of how the program would work was simple, but executing it was hard.
It required a lot of googling. Additionally, I felt like I complicated the code a lot as a result of being unfamiliar with it and would like to make it sleeker in the future. I would advise people to go to TA hours and google as 
much as possible.
